1. **Identify starting point**: The resident starts at position [4, 5].
2. **Identify the fridge access point**: The goal is to reach [1, 13].
3. **Avoid obstacles**: We need to avoid walls and objects (bed, sofa, table, fridge).
4. **Plan a clear path**: Use open paths and doors to reach the goal without overlapping previous steps.

### Steps:
- Start at [4, 5].
- Move horizontally through open space and doors.
- Navigate vertically when needed to bypass walls and objects.
- Ensure each move is valid and doesn’t cross walls or objects.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Obstacles:**
   - Walls: Avoid positions listed in `wall positions`.
   - Objects: Calculate the positions occupied by objects based on their top-left corner and size.
     - Table: Occupies positions from [8, 1] to [10, 2].
     - Fridge: Occupies positions from [6, 1] to [7, 3].
     - Bed: Occupies positions from [1, 12] to [3, 13].
     - Sofa: Occupies positions from [9, 11] to [11, 12].
     - Light: Occupies positions [13, 11] and [13, 12].

2. **Plan the Path:**
   - Start at [5, 3].
   - Use open spaces and doors to navigate around obstacles.
   - Ensure each step is valid and doesn't backtrack.

3. **Route Calculation:**
   - Move through open spaces and doors.
   - Avoid occupied and wall positions.

- **Sofa** occupies: [9, 11] to [11, 12]
- **Light** occupies: [13, 11] to [13, 12]

1. Start at [5, 3].
2. Move right to [6, 3], then [7, 3].

     - Side tables at [1, 10] and [1, 13]: occupy [1, 10] and [1, 13].
     - Table at [10, 12] with size [3, 2]: occupies [10, 12], [11, 12], [12, 12], [10, 13], [11, 13], [12, 13].
     - Light at [13, 11]: occupies [13, 11] and [13, 12].

snack10,naive,A,1,"Reasoning: 
To find a path from [9, 3] to [4, 9], we must navigate through open spaces, avoiding walls and objects. Let's identify which spaces in the grid are occupied by objects:

1. **Kitchen Objects**:
   - Table occupies positions [1, 1] to [3, 2].
   - Fridge occupies positions [5, 7] to [6, 9].
   - Light occupies positions [1, 7] to [1, 8].

2. **Living Room Objects**:
   - Table occupies positions [11, 3] to [13, 4].
   - Sofa occupies positions [11, 1] to [13, 2].

3. **Bedroom Objects**:
   - Bed occupies positions [11, 8] to [13, 9].
   - Light occupies positions [13, 12] to [13, 13].

Considering these constraints, I'll chart a viable path:

- Start at [9, 3].
- Move left to [8, 3].
- Move left to [7, 3] (through the open door).
- Move down to [6, 3].

- Move right to [4, 5].
- Move right to [4, 6].
- Move right to [4, 7].
- Move right to [4, 8].
- Move right to [4, 9].
